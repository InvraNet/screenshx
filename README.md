# ScreenSHX has its own Github Org!

This Github Org is [over here](https://github.com/ScreenSHX).

We are committed to making a great application. We decided to move everything over to an orginization due to the amount of forks that will happen to make ScreenSHX the best for the community. 

We are going to orginise our Orginization by forking projects which will be used, then we will edit them to make it as practical as possible for ScreenSHX, removing the bloat, and adding functions so ScreenSHX can function, We want this application to be as lightweight as possible, to run on hopefully any possible x86_64 hardware.
